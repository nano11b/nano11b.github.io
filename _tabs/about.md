Hi, I’m glad you’re here.

I’m someone who’s always been driven by curiosity—especially when it comes to technology, systems, and how things work behind the scenes. What started as a personal interest turned into a career path shaped by discipline, problem-solving, and a constant desire to learn and improve.

## My Background

I’m a U.S. Army veteran, having served in the Infantry and spent time stationed in South Korea. Military service taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, accountability, teamwork, and performing under pressure. Those experiences continue to influence how I approach challenges today—methodically, responsibly, and with a strong sense of purpose.

After transitioning out of the military, I leaned fully into technology. I’ve worked extensively with Linux-based systems, networking, cloud infrastructure, and security-focused solutions. I enjoy building systems that are not only functional, but secure, reliable, and designed to last.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog is a space where I share my personal journey, lessons learned, and insights from both my military and technical experiences. You’ll find topics ranging from cybersecurity and infrastructure to problem-solving, mindset, and continuous improvement.

My goal is to break down complex topics into practical, easy-to-understand ideas—whether you’re a business owner, a fellow technologist, or simply someone curious about how the digital world works.

## My Approach

I believe technology should serve people, not confuse them. That means prioritizing clarity, security, and long-term thinking over shortcuts. I value transparency, ethical practices, and solutions that actually solve problems instead of creating new ones.

Learning never stops in this field, and I make it a point to stay current while respecting the fundamentals that technology is built on.

## Outside of Technology

Outside of work, I enjoy first-person shooters, gaming communities, and spending time with my cat. These interests keep me grounded and remind me that balance is just as important as productivity.

## Thanks for Being Here

Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me. If something here resonates with you, or if you have questions or ideas you’d like to share, feel free to reach out. This blog is part of an ongoing journey, and I’m glad to have you along for it.
